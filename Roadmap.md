# NLP Roadmap 2022 (Zero to Hero) 🚀
👇 This is what you need to build real-world NLP Projects and a Good Foundation.

## 🎯 Text Pre-Processing (Use #spacy):
👉 Tokenization
👉 Lemmatization
👉 Removing Punctuations and Stopwords etc.

## 🎯 Text Representation Techniques (Feature Engineering):
👉 Bag of Words, Count Vector - #Sklearn
👉 TFIDF - #Sklearn
👉 Word2Vec - #Gensim

#### 📌 Task:
👉 Build Text Classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Xgboost, etc., and features from Count Vector, TFIDF, and Word2Vec. 
👉 Compare Results and see whether classification accuracy (or any other metric) improves as we move from Count Vectors - > TF-IDF -> Word2vec.
👉 Use word embedding or Word vectors to calculate word similarity.
👉 Train the word2vec model on custom data.

### 🎯 Learn Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Irrespective of whether you want to learn NLP or Computer Vision)
Try Hands-on with Pytorch or Tensorflow.

### 🎯 Information Extraction (Use Spacy):
👉 POS tagging
👉 Dependency parser
👉 Named Entity Recognition

#### 📌 Task:
Learn how to use a pre-trained model from Spacy for #NER and.
How to build a custom NER model.

### 🎯 Deploy Machine Learning Model:
👉 Integrate your NLP ML model into Streamlit and deploy it on the Streamlit cloud (or Heroku)
👉 Expose Model as Rest API using. Use #FastAPI or #Flask and deploy it on Heroku.
👉 Try AWS Gateway and Lambda (Serverless Deployment).

👏 Additionally:
All the above things try deployment as docker Image.
Learn git and CI/CD (Git, Github Actions).

### 🎯 Transfer Learning and Transformers Overview:
👉 Read about Transfer Learning and Transformers Architecture.
👉 Learn How #BERT (Transformers) embeddings are better than word2vec or doc2vec.

👉 Learn to use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face Transformers.
👉 Generate Sentence Embedding using Sentence Transformers (Text Representation).

👉 Learn How to fine-tune transformer models like BERT on Custom Dataset.
👉 Learn How to push fine-tuned model to the hugging face model hub and load it into your deployment environment.



#### 📌 Application of Sentence embedding:
👉 Build classification model using features generated using Sentence Transformers and fit it to algorithms like Random Forest and Xgboost
👉 Use Sentence embedding for clustering documents, semantic search, etc.

🎯 Build NLP products using Language models like GPT-3
👉 Learn how to use GPT-3 playground to check feasibility (GPT-3 prompt design).
👉 Integrate GPT-3 Prompt into code.
👉 Fine-tune GPT-3.

### 🎯 Solve popular NLP Tasks:

1. Text Classification.
2. Sentiment Analysis (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis).
3. Document Clustering.
4. Topic Modeling.
5. Named Entity Recognition.
6. Semantic Search.
7. Question Answering.
8. Conversational AI (Chatbot).
